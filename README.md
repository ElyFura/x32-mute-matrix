## Motivation
Sometimes, as the operator of an audio mixer, you just really want to see (and configure) the mute status of every channel on every bus. This program enables you to do this for your Behringer X32/M32 digital mixers.

## Features
- Manage and monitor the mute status of all 32 main inputs and 8 aux inputs on the Main bus, all 16 mixbuses, and the mono bus.
- Automatically pulls the names and colors of every bus/channel from the X32
- Connection history that remembers device addresses that have been connected to in the past.
- Installers available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Planned Features
- Stereo bus on/off
- Redesigned row and column headers
- Automatic discovery of X32/M32 devices
- Connection status indicator
- Automatic reconnection to previous device on program start
- Collapsing/folding of linked channels & buses
- Choose which channels and buses to show or hide
- Set the names and colors of channels and buses
- iOS and Android support
