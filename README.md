> See and configure the mute status of all your X32's channels (on every mixbus) in one place.

## Motivation
Sometimes, as the operator of an audio mixer, you just really want to see (and configure) the mute status of every channel on every bus. This lets you do that.

## Installation
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/lange/x32-mute-matrix/releases) page to grab the latest installer for your operating system.
Once installed, the application will autoupdate.

## Caveats
- Right now, the channel and mixbus names and colors are hardcoded to the configuration used for Tip of the Hats 2017. Eventually, these values will be pulled dynamically from the mixer itself.
- Does not yet show the Main or Mono mixes.
- Does not yet show Aux or USB inputs or FX buses.
